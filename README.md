# Download & Compile

Get the source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/mauromaiorca/enhancEM.git
```
This will local copy the file in your machine for your use.

Code can be compiled using [CMake]( https://cmake.org/install/](https://cmake.org/install/ ), with the commands:
```
cmake . 
make
sudo make install
```
Note: enhancEM uses FFTW. If FFTW is not detected during installation, cmake tries to download and compile it. So, you need to have an active internet connection while compiling enhancEM.
